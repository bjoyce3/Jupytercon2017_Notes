# Friday AM Sessions

## Citing Jupyter in scientific publications
FAIR open science framework
Jupyter notebooks can be interface between code and data
Astronomy case study
	sloan sky map
Ways citing is varied (8 different ways)
	Mentioned
		providing links in body of paper
	Citing notebook
Steps
	code and data to be shared
	decide on repo to put everything in
	obtain DOIs
	Cite these in publication

iPython: a system for interactive scientific computing 2007 DOI: 10.1109/MCSE.2007.53
Link to notebook and repo

Hope Chen
	glue
		GUI for linking data sets in Jupyter notebooks
	Combining notebook and glue
		nbglue environment setup
		%gui qt line magic

## Reproducible courses
Distinguished instructor short course
	Given around the world for one day
SimPEG tool is ued for geophysics computation
Course:
	1 day course - 8 hours
		26 notebook-apps
		560 slides
	+1 day 'lab'
		discussions, tutorials
		presentations from participants
Audience
	Industry professionals and applied academics
	1400 people, 21 countries
Contributors
	52 people, 16 on GitHub
	grad students, academics
Goals
	inspire through applications
	build a foundation
		basic principles
		realistic expectations
	maintain a community of people
Not Goals
	not a course in computation
	not assessing the learners
	not building infrastructure
Ingredients
	contributors
	instructor
	course materials
	computational tools
	participants
Traditional use of written and printed textbook is a problem
	Need to iterate in place
		Remove bugs, typos in textbook
Education stack
	Needs a community around it
	Python as a base and tools, case studies, examples, etc
From the top
	Web textbook (read the docs)
	course materials
	introduce participants to course
		case histories of scientific examples/real life applications
		Jupyter notebooks + widgets + plotting
		step by step how figure is created
Context provided by ReadtheDocs (Sphinx)
	Testing in Travis
	Sphinx for docs
On chaos
	the course will happen
	apps will be deployed
	Used in real time during course and need to be executable by single clicks
	Does it work?
		Run on my computer
		code is tested
		someone understands how it works
		there are docs in the code
		the code is structured
		docs on a website
		code is styled to standard
