# Friday AM Sessions

## Citing Jupyter in scientific publications
FAIR open science framework
Jupyter notebooks can be interface between code and data
Astronomy case study
	sloan sky map
Ways citing is varied (8 different ways)
	Mentioned
		providing links in body of paper
	Citing notebook
Steps
	code and data to be shared
	decide on repo to put everything in
	obtain DOIs
	Cite these in publication

iPython: a system for interactive scientific computing 2007 DOI: 10.1109/MCSE.2007.53
Link to notebook and repo

Hope Chen
	glue
		GUI for linking data sets in Jupyter notebooks
	Combining notebook and glue
		nbglue environment setup
		%gui qt line magic

## Reproducible courses
Distinguished instructor short course
	Given around the world for one day
SimPEG tool is ued for geophysics computation
Course:
	1 day course - 8 hours
		26 notebook-apps
		560 slides
	+1 day 'lab'
		discussions, tutorials
		presentations from participants
Audience
	Industry professionals and applied academics
	1400 people, 21 countries
Contributors
	52 people, 16 on GitHub
	grad students, academics
Goals
	inspire through applications
	build a foundation
		basic principles
		realistic expectations
	maintain a community of people
Not Goals
	not a course in computation
	not assessing the learners
	not building infrastructure
Ingredients
	contributors
	instructor
	course materials
	computational tools
	participants
Traditional use of written and printed textbook is a problem
	Need to iterate in place
		Remove bugs, typos in textbook
Education stack
	Needs a community around it
	Python as a base and tools, case studies, examples, etc
From the top
	Web textbook (read the docs)
	course materials
	introduce participants to course
		case histories of scientific examples/real life applications
		Jupyter notebooks + widgets + plotting
		step by step how figure is created
Context provided by ReadtheDocs (Sphinx)
	Testing in Travis
	Sphinx for docs
On chaos
	the course will happen
	apps will be deployed
	Used in real time during course and need to be executable by single clicks
	Does it work?
		Run on my computer
		code is tested
		someone understands how it works
		there are docs in the code
		the code is structured
		docs on a website
		code is styled to standard
Complete circle
	create reproducible course
	deploy course
	trainees extend course and tools
	submit back to original course and iterate on it
	Creates a pull forward that requires reproducibility
Challenges
	What is tied to the ecosystem
		Slides are troublesome
		Hard to do that collaboratively on Jupyter
	How do people get into the ecosystem
		Clicking on GitHub edit and submit
		Minimize roadblocks
		Simple text
Needs
	Graphs in slides and notebooks
	
	
# Friday after lunch sessions

## Numfocus
Andy - Touching Humanity
Mathematician
Hurricane Sandy was a disaster, but would normally have been worse
	Hurricane data science
	Devices in the ocean that can take measurements
	NOAA website has data
Open data science tools used with scientific community to help humanity
Traditional innovation pipeline
	scientific discovery
	archival paper
	technical innovation
	engineered code
	integration
	human problem
The problem is that scientists are very removed from the problem-solving
Innovation Ecosystem
	Scientists + human problem + technical innovation
Numfocus builds the innovation ecosystem
Why Numfocus
	Projects need funding
	projects need stability
	projects need independence
	projects need logistical support
Numfocus delivers as a 501(c)(3)
	Fiscal and legal services
		what happens when your project receives corporate funding
		iPython needed an organization to have funding from IBM to come in
		Attorneys for trademarks, ownership, contracts, legal agreements
			licensing
		Financial services
			accounts payable & receivable
			grant administration
			contractor agreements
			taxes & reporting
		Operational services
			Technical infrastructure
			conference & event planning
			consulting on a variety of admin requests
	Sustainability of project
		Engage with projects to understand needs of project
	Community
		How to support open science community?
		Why is increasing public engagement important?
		How can project interact more with the community?
			Carpentrycon next year
